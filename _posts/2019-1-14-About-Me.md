Hi, there. This is Edith Shao. 

Currently, I am senior studying CS at USC. I previously interned at EA for NBA Live 19 (C++ game dev) and Huawei Shanghai (R simple data analysis). My favorite programming language is `C++`<sup>1</sup>, but also have experience to program in `Java` and `Python`. (some class level website/data analysis project.) My resume could be find [here]({% link _files/resume.pdf %})

I am generally interested in data analysis and machine learning. (seems like the interest of all CS students these days) But it is really interesting to learn and extract information from data after several courses in DS. 

### Some irrelevant side notes: 

1. (Reason is that  it is more low level(faster), could be concise, and somehow I have a class that require C/C++ skill every semester so I never had a break from it lol)<br><br>
2. And this blog might have the most amount of grammar errors that you have ever encountered in your life. (I will try my best to avoid and fix. Anyway... Welcome ~)
