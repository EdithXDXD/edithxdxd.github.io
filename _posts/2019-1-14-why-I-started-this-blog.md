**First of all, welcome and thank you for reading my posts. (If there will be any more)**

##Motivation
I recently figured that writing is a good way to clarify priorities and reinforce memory. Starting when I was a freshman I thought about having my own blog, as I would like to write longer posts that serve as reflections to life/study, but it was only an idea. Now that I am a graduating senior with about 100 days to go, I know it is now or never to start a blog during college. I am really happy to see this simple website come live on github page. I kept my promise to myself. Yeah~

##What I planned to write in the blog

I will roughly split to (Subject to be changed) 

* `CS` - Notes and thoughts from learning various aspects of computer science
* `Life` - Things that nobody would press ❤️ on my instagram but I just want to share anyways (like cooking/exercising/randoms)
* `Archieves` - Book/Film/Blog reviews and thoughts


Now I am listing some #ToDos I plan to finish by the end of this week to make this website look nicer and have my desired functionalities.

- Add time tracking feature (last modified date)
- Add categories 
- Add comments feature 
- Optional (maybe), could switch by sorting by time/category
- Add a celebrate pic after motivation
- Summarize the changes and write a small guide about it
